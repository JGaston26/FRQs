Inscriptions in the mundane unseen
This message is not what it seems
Beneath the tapping, a secret's kept
Find the spaces, the truth's been swept

Count the clicks, the letters unfold
A code within, waiting to be told
Uncover the hidden, the mystery unveiled
The message lies where it has been trailed.
