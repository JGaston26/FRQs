shall i compare thee to a summe-r’s da-y?
thou art more lovely and more temperat-e:
rough winds do shake the darling buds of ma-y,
and summe-r’s lease hath all too short a dat-e;
sometime too hot the eye of heaven shine-s,
and often is his gold complexion dim-m'-d;
and every fair from fair sometime decline-s,
by chance or natur-e’s changing course untrim-m'-d;
but thy eternal summer shall not fad-e,
nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’s-t;
nor shall death brag thou wande-r’st in his shad-e,
when in eternal lines to time thou gro-w’s-t:
so long as men can breathe or eyes can se-e,
so long lives thi-s, and this gives life to the-e.
